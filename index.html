                              <br>
                              <h5>At 21:30 IST FaceBook/Instagram/Whatsapp Suddenly Stop working. Everyone thought that its's just a minor issue But the time increased and no response from the Facebook team. Now the problem Got Serious.</h5>
                              
                         </div>
                    </div>
                    <h2>So let us look closely into it</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Before That You need to Know what is BGP & ASN</p>

                    <h5>What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)</h5>
                    <br>

                    <p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the postal service of the Internet. When someone drops a letter into a mailbox, the postal service processes that piece of mail and chooses a fast, efficient route to deliver that letter to its recipient. Similarly, when someone submits data across the Internet, BGP is responsible for looking at all of the available paths that data could travel and picking the best route, which usually means hopping between autonomous systems.

                         BGP is the protocol that makes the Internet work. It does this by enabling data routing on the Internet. When a user in Singapore loads a website with origin servers in Argentina, BGP is the protocol that enables that communication to happen quickly and efficiently.</p>

                         <br>
                         <h5>What is ASN (Autonomous System Network)</h5>

                         <p>The Internet is a network of networks*, and autonomous systems are the big networks that make up the Internet. More specifically, an autonomous system (AS) is a large network or group of networks that has a unified routing policy. Every computer or device that connects to the Internet is connected to an AS.</p>

                    <div class="blog-post-thumb">
                         <div class="blog-post-image">
                              
                                   <img src="images/network-of-networks.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image">
                              
                         </div>

                         <p>Imagine an AS as being like a town's post office. Mail goes from post office to post office until it reaches the right town, and that town's post office will then deliver the mail within that town. Similarly, data packets cross the Internet by hopping from AS to AS until they reach the AS that contains their destination Internet Protocol (IP) address. Routers within that AS send the packet to the IP address.</p>
                         <br>

                              <p>Every AS controls a specific set of IP addresses, just as every town's post office is responsible for delivering mail to all the addresses within that town. The range of IP addresses that a given AS has control over is called their "IP address space."</p>
                              <br>
                              
                              <p>Most ASes connect to several other ASes. If an AS connects to only one other AS and shares the same routing policy, it may instead be considered a subnetwork of the first AS.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>Typically, each AS is operated by a single large organization, such as an Internet service provider (ISP), a large enterprise technology company, a university, or a government agency.</p>

                                   <img src="images/autonomous-system-diagram1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image">
                              </div>
                         </div>

                         <div class="blog-post-title">
                              <h2><a>Now What is the issue ?</a></h2>
                         </div>
                         
                         <div class="blog-post-des"></div>
                              <p>The big routers that make the Internet work have huge, constantly updated lists of the possible routes that can be used to deliver every network packet to their final destinations. Without BGP, the Internet routers wouldn't know what to do, and the Internet wouldn't work.</p><br>
                              <p>The Internet is literally a network of networks, and it’s bound together by BGP. BGP allows one network (say Facebook) to advertise its presence to other networks that form the Internet. As we write Facebook is not advertising its presence, ISPs and other networks can’t find Facebook’s network and so it is unavailable.</p><br>
                              <p>The individual networks each have an ASN: an Autonomous System Number. An Autonomous System (AS) is an individual network with a unified internal routing policy. An AS can originate prefixes (say that they control a group of IP addresses), as well as transit prefixes (say they know how to reach specific groups of IP addresses).</p><br>
                              <p>Cloudflare's ASN is AS13335. Every ASN needs to announce its prefix routes to the Internet using BGP; otherwise, no one will know how to connect and where to find us.</p><br>
                              <p>Our learning center has a good overview of what BGP and ASNs are and how they work.</p><br>
                              <p>In this simplified diagram, you can see six autonomous systems on the Internet and two possible routes that one packet can use to go from Start to End. AS1 → AS2 → AS3 being the fastest, and AS1 → AS6 → AS5 → AS4 → AS3 being the slowest, but that can be used if the first fails.</p><br>
                              <p>Then Facebook had stopped announcing the routes to their DNS prefixes. That meant that, at least, Facebook’s DNS servers were unavailable. Because of this Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver could no longer respond to queries asking for the IP address of facebook.com or instagram.com.</p><br>
                         </div>
                    </div>
                    
                              
                         <img src="images/Router.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image"><br>
                    

                    <p>Meanwhile, other Facebook IP addresses remained routed but weren’t particularly useful since without DNS Facebook and related services were effectively unavailable:</p><br>

                    <img src="images/BGP.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image"><br>

                    <p>And keep track of all the BGP updates and announcements we see in our global network. At our scale, the data we collect gives us a view of how the Internet is connected and where the traffic is meant to flow from and to everywhere on the planet.</p><br>
                    <p>A BGP UPDATE message informs a router of any changes you’ve made to a prefix advertisement or entirely withdraws the prefix. We can clearly see this in the number of updates we received from Facebook when checking our time-series BGP database. Normally this chart is fairly quiet: Facebook doesn’t make a lot of changes to its network minute to minute.

                    </p><br>

                    <p>But at around 09:40 IST we saw a peak of routing changes from Facebook. That’s when the trouble began.</p><br>

                    <img src="images/image4-10.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image"><br>


                    <h2>DNF Affected</h2>

                    

                    <p>As a direct consequence of this, DNS resolvers all over the world stopped resolving their domain names.

                         This happens because DNS, like many other systems on the Internet, also has its routing mechanism. When someone types the https://facebook.com URL in the browser, the DNS resolver, responsible for translating domain names into actual IP addresses to connect to, first checks if it has something in its cache and uses it. If not, it tries to grab the answer from the domain nameservers, typically hosted by the entity that owns it.</p><br>

                    <p>If the nameservers are unreachable or fail to respond because of some other reason, then a SERVFAIL is returned, and the browser issues an error to the user.</p><br>
                    <p>Due to Facebook stopping announcing their DNS prefix routes through BGP, our and everyone else's DNS resolvers had no way to connect to their nameservers. Consequently, 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and other major public DNS resolvers started issuing (and caching) SERVFAIL responses.</p><br>
                    <p>But that's not all. Now human behavior and application logic kicks in and causes another exponential effect. A tsunami of additional DNS traffic follows.</p><br>
                    <p>This happened in part because apps won't accept an error for an answer and start retrying, sometimes aggressively, and in part because end-users also won't take an error for an answer and start reloading the pages, or killing and relaunching their apps, sometimes also aggressively.

                         This is the traffic increase (in number of requests) that we saw on 1.1.1.1:</p><br>
                         <p>Again, our learning center provides a good explanation on how DNS works.</p><br>


                         <img src="images/image1-12.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image"><br>

                    <P>So now, because Facebook and their sites are so big, we have DNS resolvers worldwide handling 30x more queries than usual and potentially causing latency and timeout issues to other platforms.</P>
                    <br>
                    <p>Fortunately, 1.1.1.1 was built to be Free, Private, Fast (as the independent DNS monitor DNSPerf can attest), and scalable, and we were able to keep servicing our users with minimal impact.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The vast majority of our DNS requests kept resolving in under 10ms. At the same time, a minimal fraction of p95 and p99 percentiles saw increased response times, probably due to expired TTLs having to resort to the Facebook nameservers and timeout. The 10 seconds DNS timeout limit is well known amongst engineers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We can also see another side effect of this unreachability in our WARP traffic to and from Facebook's affected ASN 32934. This chart shows how traffic changed from 15:45 UTC to 16:45 UTC compared with three hours before in each country. All over the world WARP traffic to and from Facebook’s network simply disappeared.</p>
                    <br>

                    <img src="images/image7-6.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Blog Image"><br>
                    <h2>Impact</h2>

                    <p>People look for alternatives and want to know more or discuss what’s going on. When Facebook became unreachable, we started seeing increased DNS queries to Twitter, Signal and other messaging and social media platforms.

                    </p>

                    <h2>FINAL REPORT FROM FACEBOOK :</h2>
                    <p>To all the people and businesses around the world who depend on us, we are sorry for the inconvenience caused by today’s outage across our platforms. We’ve been working as hard as we can to restore access, and our systems are now back up and running. The underlying cause of this outage also impacted many of the internal tools and systems we use in our day-to-day operations, complicating our attempts to quickly diagnose and resolve the problem.</p><br>

                    <p>Our engineering teams have learned that configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers caused issues that interrupted this communication. This disruption to network traffic had a cascading effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a halt.</p><br>

                    <p>Our services are now back online and we’re actively working to fully return them to regular operations. We want to make clear at this time we believe the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change. We also have no evidence that user data was compromised as a result of this downtime.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>People and businesses around the world rely on us everyday to stay connected. We understand the impact outages like these have on people’s lives, and our responsibility to keep people informed about disruptions to our services. We apologize to all those affected, and we’re working to understand more about what happened today so we can continue to make our infrastructure more resilient.</p><br>
